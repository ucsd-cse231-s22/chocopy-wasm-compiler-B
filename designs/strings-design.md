# Week 10
We successfully implemented the methods we promised in last week. The methods we implemented included:
    * Slicing (extending index access)
    * Reverse (negative) indexing
    * .lower() method
    * .upper() method

The main reason that the split() method could not be implemented was that we could not get the latest implementation from the lists group and we expect their memory layout to change from the last merge. For the same reason, we also expect conflicts with lists in term of slicing and reverse indexing.

## BigInt issue
We expected errors when merging BigInt implementatin. This should not be a big problem because BigInt group should have provided an function to cast `BigInt` back to `i32`.


# Week 9 Update
We are planning on adding more features and integrating our designs with other groups, especially with lists and bingnums.

## Integration
We will be using the provided function that converts a bignum to an `i32` primitive in our indexing method. We will be modifying parts of our parsers that deal with indexing and index assignment together with the list group so we don't have any conflicts there.

## Additional Functionalities
We wish to add the following functionalities to strings:
    * Slicing (extending index access)
    * Reverse (negative) indexing
    * .lower() method
    * .upper() method
    * .split(delim) method (which is interesting since it returns a list)
Slicing and reverse indexing are simple to implement as they only require some simple arithmetic processing of the indices. 
lower and upper method would require us to do some ascii arithmetic but should also be relatively simple.
The split method on the other hand would require us to interface with the list group and should be the most challenging but also most interesting functionality to implement.

# Week 8 Update
We have flushed out our design and managed to pass all the tests. The output of the tests are shown below. The updated design section is shown after the tests.
## TEST CASES and output:

print(f("asd"))
```

```
class C(object):
    s:str = "asd"
    def gets(self: C)->str:
        return self.s
c:C = None
c = C()
print(c.gets())
``` 
Output: "asd"

## Design and Modification to the Code-base
* ast: 
    * add ``` { tag: "str", value: string}``` to Literal: this is because strings are treated as literals in the python language
    * add ```{strarg?:string}``` field to the construct Expression node: this is because we are treating strings as objects and need to pass string literals as parameters to the constructor. However, since WAT does not support strings, we are passing them in the compiler with this field.
* ir: No changes
* New functions/files: add String.wat to codebase. String.wat would contain the implementation of the string class. The String class would include methods such as access, greater_than, equals_to etc.
* Compiler (Changes Pending): We made two minor yet crucial changes to the compiler. We understand that we should not tamper with the compiler lightly, but without these changes our design would not be able to function. We think there are no good work around for these changes. However, we do think that some of these work might be better suited for the Frontend Team or the Buildin Library Team. As for now, these changes are required for us to pass our tests.
    * added ```print_str``` function: the current printers cannot interface with the `str` class. We added a new printer to print strings. 
    * added a function that loads our string class implementation `string.wat` to the very front of the compiled code.
* New value representation/memory layout: we implemented our string as a consecutive chunk of bytes on the memory representing ascii values. The `str` class provides interface for the string. A psudocode representation of `str` class's variable members are as follows. The class occupies a consecutive chunk of memory, with the first four bytes always dedicated to storing the length of the string. The remaining bytes store the ascii vlaues of the string right after the length bytes.
```
class str:
    length:int
    s:string
``` 
* Implementation Notes: Strings are special in that they behave like both a literal and a class. This has two implications:
    1. When a string is assigned in an variable definition, its constructor is called. To fit this into the current framework where each literal in the python language is assumed to have a direct counterpart in WASM, we refactor the AST tree during the Type Checking step. ```s:str = "abc"``` is refactored into ```s:str = None, s = str("abc")```. If the string is declared in the main body, the constructor is call at the beginning of the main body. If the string is declared in a method of a function, the constructor is called at the beginning of the funciton. If the string is declared as a member of a class, the constructor is called at the beginning of the class's initializer.
    2. When certain operators are called with strings as operands, certain member methods are called. Similarly, we refactor the binop expression into a method call at the Type Checking step. For instance, ```"abc" + "abc"``` is refactored into ``` "abc".concat("abc")```.
    3. Some further notes: 
        * python strings are immutable. This means that ```s:str = "abc", s[0] = 'a'``` produces a type error in python. This is done for good reason as strings are considered to be literals, meaning that when we interact with them, we should not feel like we are interacting with memory. This is very different from languages such as C where strings are simply defined as null terminated arrays. We preserve this behavior, meaning that 
            1. We do not allow any manipulation to a string object. Once a string object is created, its fields stay constant until it is destroyed
            2. All methods that return strings (including constructors, the concatenate (+) operator etc.) create new string objects. They do not reuse memory from older string object.
        * We added some new files in the test folder to help with `npm test`. Some of these file contain important implementation for our tests, meaning that importing a function of the same from another test helper will not produce the correct results for strings.

## Changes to code base
* ast: add ``` { tag: "str", value: string}``` to Literal
* ir: No changes
* New functions/files: add String.wat to codebase. String.wat would contain the implementation of the string class. The String class would include methods such as access, greater_than, equals_to etc.
* New value representation/memory layout: we are either going to implement strings are arrays of ascii bytes or unicode byte-string (which is how python actually implements them). If we are going to stick to the ascii representation, we are going to store strings in memory as arrays with byte-size-elements. If we are going to implement the unicode representation, we are going to store strings as byte-strings with variable length elements with sizes between 1 and 4 bytes. We will also need a codec to decode the byte-string.
