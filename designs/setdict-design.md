# Set/Tuple/Dictionary: Project Design

## Week 8 Update
There are two main goals we want to achieve in the remaining work:
1. Finish all basic set functionalities.
2. Integrate our work with other groups such as lists, strings and bignums.

### About the set functionalities: 

In Week 7, we implemented some of the basic functionalities of sets, including the initialization, len(set), set.add(), set.remove(), the "in" keyword, etc. We proposed some different test cases because we didn't implement a print_set() function. ~~We are also trying to move all the set-related functions into a new file called sets.wat under the /stdlib directory, and build it into sets.wasm to load all the functions into the code. There's still a bug left in our code such that it failed local tests but behaved normally when running in the browser. So in this pull request, in order to pass the local tests without any error, we put the set-related wasm code in the memory.wat temporarily.~~ So our first two tasks are to fix these two problems. **UPDATE: The second problem was fixed.** 

Next, our goal is to implement all the remaining set functionalities. We wish to implement set.update() and set.clear(), as well as throwing runtime error when removing non-existing elements from sets. We will be able to pass all test cases we originally proposed once we finish implementing all these tasks.

### About integrating our work with other groups:
Currently our set can only store primitive types. We want to extend our implementation to be able to store strings and bignums in the sets. Possible scenarios are as follows:

1. Storing strings in sets
```python
set_1 : set[str] = None
set_1 = {“abc”, “def”}
print(set_1)   # output {"abc", "def"}
set_1.add(“xyz”)
print(set_1)   # output {"abc", "def", "xyz"}
```

2. Storing bignums in sets
```python
set_1 : set[int] = None
set_1 = {1,
99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999998}
set_1.add(99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999997)
print(set_1)   # output {1, 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999998, 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999997}
```

Also, since the set() constructor and set.update() take in iterables as arguments, we want to extend our implementation to be able to pass in lists and strings to these functions. Possible scenarios are as follows:

1. Constructing and updating sets using strings
```python
set_1 : set[str] = None
set_1 = set(“abc”)
print(set_1)   # output {"a", "b", "c"}
set_1.update("xy")
print(set_1)   # output {"a", "b", "c", "x", "y"}
```

2. Constructing and updating sets using lists
```python
set_1 : set[int] = None
set_1 = set([1,1,2])
print(set_1)    # output {1, 2}
set_1.update([2,3])
print(set_1)    # output {1, 2, 3}
```


## Week 7 Update

### Passed Test Cases:
1. Initialize the set, and measure the length of the set using len().
```python
set_1 : set[int] = None
set_1 = {1,2}
print(len(set_1)) # output 2
```

2. Add elements to the set.
```python
set_1 : set[int] = None
set_1 = {1,2}
set_1.add(3)
print(len(set_1)) # output 3
```

3. Use the "in" keyword to see if an element exists in the set.
```python
set_1 : set[int] = None
set_1 = {1,2}
set_1.add(3)
print(3 in set_1) # output True
```

4. "in" should return False if element doesn't exist.
```python
set_1 : set[int] = None
set_1 = {1,2}
set_1.add(3)
print(4 in set_1) # output False
```

5. Duplicate elements will not be inserted into the set again.
```python
set_1 : set[int] = None
set_1 = {1,2}
set_1.add(1)
print(len(set_1))  # output 2   
```

6. Use remove() to remove an element from the set.
```python
set_1 : set[int] = None
set_1 = {1,2}
set_1.remove(1)
print(len(set_1)) # output 1 
```

7. "in" should return False after removing
```python
set_1 : set[int] = None
set_1 = {1,2}
set_1.remove(1)
print(1 in set_1) # output False
```


Some functionalities remaining: set() constructor; remove() non existing element should throw runtime error; clear(); update() (should include iterable -- string, list, set...), copy().

Initially we wanted to implement the set using a linear memory layout, but that still requires writing wasm code for searching for duplicates while adding to the set, yielding O(n) time complexity. We then switched to a hash-based solution, implementing a hash table in wasm. We currently use mod10 as our hash function, and therefore give out 10 buckets in the table. Each bucket is initially assigned 4 bytes to store the starting address and maintains a linked list. The functions such as add(), remove(), "in" all perform similarly: use the hash function to find the correct bucket, then iterate through the linked list to perform further actions.

In the following weeks, we expect to 1. provide support for the remaining functionalities and behaviors of set; 2. extend our implementation to work with strings and lists; 3. if there's enough time, we will also try to implement tuple and dictionary.

## Test Cases
1. Initialize a set.   
```python
set_1 : set[int] = {1, 2} 
print(set_1)   # should output {1, 2}
```

2. Add a single value to the set.
```python 
set_1 : set[int] = {1}
set_1.add(5)  
print(set_1)   # should output {1, 5}
```

3. Remove a certain value that exists in the set.  
```python 
set_1 : set[int] = {1, 2} 
set_1.remove(1)
print(set_1)   # should output {2}
```

4. Initialize an empty set using the set constructor.
```python
set_1 : set[int] = set() 
print(set_1)    # should output set()
```

5. Add elements to the set. The parameter should be iterable 
```python
set_1 : set[int] = {1, 2} 
set_1.update({3,4})
print(set_1)   # should output {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

6. Add the same element to the set
```python
set_1 : set[int] = {1}
set_1.add(5)  
print(set_1)   # should output {1, 5}
set_1.add(5)
print(set_1)   # should output {1, 5}
```

7. Try to remove non existing element from the set, raise KeyError
```python
set_1 : set[int] = {5, 6}
set_1.remove(2)    # KeyError: key doesn't exist
```

8. Try to add unhashable elements to the set using add(). Raise TypeError.
```python
set_1 : set[int] = {1}
set_1.add({5, 6})   # TypeError: unhashable type "set"
```

9. Try to update the set with non iterable elements. Raise TypeError
```python
set_1 : set[int] = {1, 2} 
set_1.update(3)   # TypeError: 3 is not iterable
```

10. Remove all elements in the set
```python
set_1 : set[int] = {1, 2} 
set_1.clear()
print(set_1)   # should output set()
```


## Changes To AST/IR
AST:
```python
export type Type =
  | { tag: "set", valueType: Type }
export type Expr<A> =
  | { a?: A, tag: "bracket", values: Array<Expr<A>>}
```

No need to update IR for now.

## New Functions/Datatypes
The new datatype Set will be added to the codebase. We will likely need to add a new function in `lower.ts` to handle different method calls of sets (i.e., `update()`, `add()`, `remove()`, `clear()`). 

## Value Representation & Memory Layout
One variable stores the memory address of the set object, and each element in the set will be represented as i32. We will implement the set using a hash table that is represented as a fixed-size array of buckets of hashables. Each bucket will be pointed to a linked list that stores hashables. All hashables in the same bucket share the same hash value that is used to index into the array of buckets. We create a hash function that turns a key into an index and determines which bucket the hashable will go into. The hash function will also be used to determine how many buckets we need to create.
